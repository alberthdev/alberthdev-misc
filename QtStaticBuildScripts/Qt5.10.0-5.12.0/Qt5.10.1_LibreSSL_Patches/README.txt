Qt v5.10.1 LibreSSL Patches
============================
These patches attempt to provide compatability with LibreSSL ~v2.6, and
are by the Void Linux team under the license specified in COPYING.txt.

We use two patches directly from here:
https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/426d7e2210e250241038d4ed80f7a906003122da/srcpkgs/qt5/patches/libressl-compat.patch
https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/426d7e2210e250241038d4ed80f7a906003122da/srcpkgs/qt5/patches/libressl-no-opensslv11.patch

All of their Qt5 specific patches can be found here:
https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/tree/426d7e2210e250241038d4ed80f7a906003122da/srcpkgs/qt5/patches

Note that these patches have since been updated for later versions of LibreSSL.
