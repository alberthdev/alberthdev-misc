Miscellaneous things I've created that are not big enough for a dedicated repository.

## Subprojects:

 * [HexChat - Debian Stretch To Jessie Package Converter](HexChat_Debian_Stretch_To_Jessie_Package_Converter/) - a
   simple shell script to convert a Debian Stretch HexChat package to a Jessie-compatible one. The stretch package
   is backwards-compatible with Jessie, but a dependency must be renamed for the package to install.
   The script provided here automates the process.
